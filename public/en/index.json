Effects of various musical acoustic elements on emotions in non-human animals have not been studied with an integrated approach. However, this knowledge is important to design music to provide environmental enrichment for non-human species. Thirty-nine instrumental musical pieces were composed and used to determine effects of various acoustic parameters on emotional responses in farm pigs. Video recordings (n=50) of pigs in the nursery phase (7–9 week old) were gathered and emotional responses induced by stimuli were evaluated with Qualitative Behavioral Assessment (QBA). Non-parametric statistical models (Generalized Additive Models, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost) were applied and compared to evaluate relationships between acoustic parameters and pigs’ observed emotional responses. We concluded that musical structure affected emotional responses of pigs. The valence of modulated emotions depended on integrated and simultaneous interactions of various spectral and temporal structural components of music that can be readily modified. This new knowledge supports design of musical stimuli to be used as environmental enrichment for non-human animals.","tags":["Acoustic","Machine Learning","Music"],"title":"Spectro-temporal acoustic elements of music interact in an integrated way to modulate emotional responses in pigs","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655424000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655424000,"objectID":"3cc5d9314ada372e0d740206b9858e17","permalink":"https://edimer.netlify.app/en/publication/sistemas-de-produccion-pollo/","publishdate":"2022-06-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/sistemas-de-produccion-pollo/","section":"publication","summary":"Introducción- La producción de pollo de engorde es de gran interés para el departamento de Santander dada su alta participación dentro del PIB pecuario, lo que lo constituye en el principal centro avícola nacional. Es importante conocer las condiciones bajo las cuales se realiza la producción de pollo de engorde e identificar el potencial que tienen estos sistemas de producción. Objetivo- caracterizar los sistemas de producción industrial de pollo de engorde ubicados en el departamento de Santander. Materiales y métodos- Para el desarrollo del trabajo se contó con información proveniente de 79 predios avícolas los cuales se encontraban ubicados en 4 provincias- Metropolitana, Soto, Guanentá y Yariguíes. Se realizó un análisis de clúster y se generó un índice de adopción tecnológica. Resultados- Se encontró que existe variación en la adopción de tecnologías, siendo las más frecuentes las tecnologías blandas. Santander obtuvo un índice de adopción tecnológica bajo. Conclusiones- El sector avícola del departamento de Santander posee un bajo índice de adopción tecnológica, lo cual sugiere la necesidad de evaluar el efecto que esto tiene sobre los resultados productivos con miras al incremento de la productividad a largo plazo en la zona","tags":["Poultry","Multivariate statistics"],"title":"Caracterización de Sistemas de Producción Industrial de Pollo de Engorde en el Departamento de Santander- Colombia","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1646092800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646092800,"objectID":"062233abffb0f36fd9f369b035c26789","permalink":"https://edimer.netlify.app/en/publication/music-modulates-emotional/","publishdate":"2022-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/music-modulates-emotional/","section":"publication","summary":"There is a lack of clarity on whether pigs can emotionally respond to musical stimulation and whether that response is related to music structure. Qualitative Behavioral Assessment (QBA) was used to evaluate effects of 16 distinct musical pieces (in terms of harmonic structure) on emotional responses in nursery pigs (n=30) during four periods- “habituation”, “treatments”, “breaks” and “final”. Data were evaluated using Principal component analysis (PCA). Two principal components (PC) were considered in the analysis- PC1, characterized as a positive emotions index, included the emotional responses content, playful, sociable, and happy, whereas PC2, characterized as a negative emotions index, included fearful, inquisitive, and uneasy with positive loadings, and relaxed and calm with negative loadings. Musical stimulation (treatment) increased (P\u003c0.01) both emotional indices, compared to other periods and this response was influenced by harmonic characteristics of the music. We concluded that pigs have a wide variety of emotional responses, with different affective states related to the music structure used, providing evidence of its potential use as environmental enrichment for this species.","tags":["Music","Multivariate statistics","General linear mixed model"],"title":"Music modulates emotional responses in growing pigs","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604217600,"objectID":"d9a7890e5f9c388703e229d0a9e20ec7","permalink":"https://edimer.netlify.app/en/talk/design-and-statistical-analysis-of-experiments-in-cannabis/","publishdate":"2020-11-01T12:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/talk/design-and-statistical-analysis-of-experiments-in-cannabis/","section":"event","summary":"Design and statistical analysis of experiments in Cannabis agronomic tests.","tags":["Experiment design","Agriculture"],"title":"Design and statistical analysis of experiments in Cannabis","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601539200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601539200,"objectID":"16c5661b00ce5f4b77291c995ec2c1cd","permalink":"https://edimer.netlify.app/en/talk/data-science-with-r-uses-in-the-agricultural-sector-example-in-plant-tissue-culture/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T08:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/talk/data-science-with-r-uses-in-the-agricultural-sector-example-in-plant-tissue-culture/","section":"event","summary":"Data science and its applications in the agricultural sector.","tags":["Data Science","Agriculture"],"title":"Data Science with R - uses in the agricultural sector (example in plant tissue culture)","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1596268800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596268800,"objectID":"6457ac05ddfaa4a20f20ddb881993d31","permalink":"https://edimer.netlify.app/en/talk/creating-applications-with-shiny/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T12:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/talk/creating-applications-with-shiny/","section":"event","summary":"Introduction to creating applications with shiny in R.","tags":["Shiny","R"],"title":"Creating applications with shiny","type":"event"}]
